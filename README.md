acs_file_download: Course Material Crawler
Project Overview

Hey there, welcome to my little project â€“ "acs_file_download"! This GitHub repository is where I'm sharing a nifty Go program that 
I've been working on in my free time. Its main gig? 
Crawling and grabbing course materials from the Applied Computer Science department at my university. 

About the Project

So, here's the deal. I wanted a way to make downloading course materials a piece of cake. That's why I built "acs_file_download" using the power of Go.
Key Features

    Course Material Crawler: My little program can crawl through acs sources, gathering all those course materials you need.

    Quick Downloads: When it finds something useful, it downloads it, no fuss. I'm all about efficiency, after all.


Why This Matters

In the age of scattered resources, I thought it'd be cool to have a one-stop-shop for course materials. 
I'm all about promoting self-directed learning and making life a bit easier for my fellow students.

Usage

If you're curious and want to try it out, you can find the instructions in the project's documentation. 
I tried to make them as simple as possible, so you can get started without any hassle.
